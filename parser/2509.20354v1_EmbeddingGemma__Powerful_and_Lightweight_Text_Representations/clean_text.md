We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model based on the Gemma 3
language model family. Our innovative training recipe strategically captures knowledge from larger
models via encoder-decoder initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model
robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure generalizability by merging
checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures. Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark
(MTEB) across multilingual, English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-
of-the-art results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open, with fewer
than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models double its size, offering an
exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably, this lead persists when quantizing model weights or
truncating embedding outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency
and high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation studies exploring
our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the community to promote further research.
1. Introduction
Text embedding models map natural language to fixed-length vector representations, placing seman-
tically similar text near each other in the embedding space. This has made them a popular choice for
tasks like semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering. Recent research has built towards
the goal of creating general-purpose models that are able to excel at many of these tasks simultane-
ously, attempting to develop the models themselves (Su et al., 2023) and crafting benchmarks focused
on task and domain generalization (Muennighoff et al., 2022). As large language models (LLMs) have
grown larger and more powerful, they have become integral in the ever-improving development of
these general-purpose embedding models via techniques such as synthetic data generation and hard
negative mining (Lee et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b), and by initializing embedding models with
LLM weights (Ni et al., 2021). As a result, much of the recent literature has centered around large
models on the order of several billion parameters, such as NV-Embed (Lee et al., 2025a), GritLM-7B
(Muennighoff et al., 2025), and E5-Mistral (Wang et al., 2024b).

EmbeddingGemma: Powerful and Lightweight Text Representations
Figure 1 | Comparison of top 20 embedding models under 500M parameters across MTEB multilingual
and code benchmarks. We exclude models trained on more than 25% of the MTEB data to mitigate
potential over-fitting. ∗: Average excludes COIRCodeSearchNetRetrieval, which was unavailable for
most models. An analogous figure for MTEB(English, v2) is available in Section A.
However, while the trend towards larger models has pushed the boundaries of performance, it
has also highlighted a critical trade-off between capability and computational cost. State-of-the-art
models are often too large and computationally expensive for many real-world applications, which
often require low-latency, high-throughput inference. This is especially true for applications requiring
on-device deployment, such as those involving sensitive data or offline access. This has led to a
growing interest in developing lightweight models that can deliver strong performance without the
need for extensive computational resources (Belcak et al., 2025), presenting a significant opportunity
to further advance the capabilities of these smaller models.
In this paper, we introduce EmbeddingGemma,2 a novel, 308M parameter embedding model
built on the architecture of the powerful Gemma 3 language model family (Team, 2025). In order
to leverage richer encoder representations, we first adapt Gemma 3 into an encoder-decoder model
using the UL2 (Tay et al., 2023) objective, following T5Gemma (Zhang et al., 2025a). We then
initialize EmbeddingGemma from the encoder of this encoder-decoder model. During training,
we distill the state-of-the-art Gemini Embedding (Lee et al., 2025b) using embedding matching
(Kim et al., 2023). We also include a “spread-out” regularizer to improve EmbeddingGemma’s
expressiveness and robustness. Building upon the success of Gecko and models that followed it (Lee
et al., 2024, 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025b), we include task prompts and a pre-finetuning stage to
improve performance. Finally, we utilize model souping (Wortsman et al., 2022) to combine multiple
finetuned checkpoints, opting to combine models trained on different finetuning mixtures rather than
different hyperparameter configurations. This results in final embedding model with stronger, more
generalizable representations.
To rigorously assess EmbeddingGemma’s capabilities, we conduct extensive evaluations on multiple
benchmarks. We mostly utilize the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) test suite (Enevoldsen
et al., 2025; Muennighoff et al., 2022); notably, its multilingual benchmark MTEB(Multilingual, v2)
includes over 100 tasks spanning 250+ languages, 20 domains, and 9 task types such as classification,
clustering, retrieval, and semantic similarity. As visualized in Figure 1, EmbeddingGemma achieves

state-of-the-art performance on MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), and MTEB(English, v2)
leaderboards for models under 500M parameters, ranking first across all aggregate metrics:3 Borda
count, mean over all task scores, and mean over all task type scores. Moreover, EmbeddingGemma
represents a drastic improvement over the previous state-of-the-art: on MTEB(Multilingual, v2), for
example, EmbeddingGemma ranks 8th overall, 17 places above the second-best sub-500M parameter
model. EmbeddingGemma’s performance is so strong it is comparable to models nearly double its
size (Table 5). Impressively, EmbeddingGemma’s lead persists even when truncating embeddings to
as low as 128 dimensions or quantizing weights down to as low as 4-bit precision.
We also conduct detailed ablation studies to elucidate the factors contributing to the stellar
performance of EmbeddingGemma. We find that though initializing model parameters from decoder-
only LLMs indeed greatly improves performance (Lee et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025b), encoder-
decoder models offer a stronger starting point. This is thanks to the encoder-decoder architecture’s
stronger contextual representations, which likely come from (i) the use of bidirectional attention and
(ii) encoder parameters being able to specialize in input understanding (Tay et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,
2025a). Counterintuitively, our experiments also show that simple pooling types tend to outperform
attention pooling in embedding tasks despite using no learnable parameters. Our analysis also reveals
that model souping works by varying finetuning mixtures instead of hyperparameters, perhaps in
part due to our mixtures yielding models specialized in different areas. We also compare per-channel
and per-block quantization-aware training and confirm they yield models robust to quantization.
2. EmbeddingGemma
2.1. Architecture
EmbeddingGemma is an encoder-only transformer model adapted from a pretrained 300M decoder-
only Gemma 3 model. Specifically, we adapt the Gemma 3 model into an encoder-decoder model
following the T5Gemma recipe (Zhang et al., 2025a), and then initialize EmbeddingGemma from the
encoder of this encoder-decoder model. This way, EmbeddingGemma is able to harness the extensive
world knowledge of Gemma 3. Using an encoder-decoder adaptation further ensures the encoder is
able to produce expressive representations from the start.
Specifically, given an input sequence T of 𝐿tokens, we first apply M𝑛, an 𝑛-layer transformer
with bidirectional attention, and produce a sequence of token embeddings Tembed = M𝑛(T) ∈ℝ𝐿×𝑑𝑀,
where 𝑑𝑀is the model dimension used for the transformer’s inner representations. We then employ a
mean pooling P, which averages the token embeddings along the sequence axis to generate a single
embedding representing all the information in the input, producing Pembed = P(Tembed) ∈ℝ𝑑𝑀. Next,
we apply a randomly initialized linear projection 𝑔to upscale the embedding to an intermediate
embedding dimension 𝑑𝑈, producing E𝑈= 𝑔(Pembed) ∈ℝ𝑑𝑈. Finally, we apply another randomly
initialized linear projection 𝑓to scale the embedding to the target dimension 𝑑, resulting in E =
𝑓(E𝑈) ∈ℝ𝑑. In EmbeddingGemma, we use 𝑛= 24, 𝑑𝑀= 768, 𝑑𝑈= 3072, 𝑑= 768.
2.2. Training
Input
Each training example includes a query 𝑞𝑖, a positive passage 𝑝+
𝑖, and (optionally) a hard
negative passage 𝑝−
𝑖. Each example also has prescribed task strings 𝑡𝑞and 𝑡𝑝for queries and passages
respectively, describing the nature of the task. For instance, for retrieval we use “task: search result |
query: {content}” and “title: {title | ‘none’} | text: {content}”.

EmbeddingGemma: Powerful and Lightweight Text Representations
The query and passages are embedded as vectors in ℝ𝑑:
q𝑖= 𝑓(𝑔(P(M𝑛(𝑡𝑞⊕𝑞𝑖)))),
p±
𝑖= 𝑓(𝑔(P(M𝑛(𝑡𝑝⊕𝑝±
𝑖)))).
(1)
Objective
EmbeddingGemma was trained using three different losses. The first is a noise-contrastive
estimation (NCE) loss with in-batch negatives. Given a batch B of size 𝐵:= |B|, we define the
contrastive loss as:
LC = 1
𝐵
𝐵
∑︁
𝑖=1

−log
𝑒sim(q𝑖,p+
𝑖)/𝜏
𝑤𝑖𝑒sim(q𝑖,p−
𝑖)/𝜏+ Í𝐵
𝑗=1 𝟙TN(𝑖, 𝑗) 𝑒sim(q𝑖,p+
𝑗)/𝜏

(2)
where sim(x, y) = x⊤y/∥x∥∥y∥is cosine similarity, and 𝟙TN masks out false negatives from duplicates:
𝟙TN(𝑖, 𝑗) =
(
0
if 𝑞𝑖= 𝑞𝑗or 𝑝+
𝑖= 𝑝+
𝑗,
1
otherwise.
(3)
The hardness weight 𝑤𝑖represents how challenging a (query, hard negative passage) pair is for the
model to differentiate between, forcing it to learn more discriminative representations (Lan et al.,
2025). This is defined as 𝑤𝑖= exp(𝛼sg(sim(q𝑖, p−
𝑖))), where sg(·) is the stop-gradient operator, and
𝛼is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the weighting, experimentally set to 5.0. The
stop-gradient ensures we are weighing based on the current difficulty and not differentiating through
the weight factor itself.
The second loss is based on the global orthogonal regularizer (GOR) introduced in Zhang et al.
(2017). This loss encourages EmbeddingGemma to produce embeddings that are spread out over the
embedding space, to fully utilize the expressive power of the embedding space. This also intends
to ensure that a) the model is robust to quantization (especially embedding quantization), and that
b) the embeddings produced by the model can be retrieved efficiently in vector databases using
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms. We define the spread-out loss as:
LS =
1
𝐵(𝐵−1)
∑︁
𝑖,𝑗∈B : 𝑖≠𝑗
(q⊤
𝑖q𝑗)2 +
1
𝐵(𝐵−1)
∑︁
𝑖,𝑗∈B : 𝑖≠𝑗
(p+⊤
𝑖
p+
𝑗)2.
(4)
The idea is to make the embeddings of a random pair of inputs have similar statistical properties
(mean and second moment) as two points independently and uniformly sampled from the unit sphere.
We use only the “second moment” term of the regularizer’s original definition, as we find this also
sufficiently pushes the “mean” term towards its target value.
The third and final is an embedding matching loss based on Kim et al. (2023). In contrast to
previous distillation research which has relied only on the teacher’s query-document relevance scores
as a signal (de Souza P. Moreira et al., 2025; Santhanam et al., 2022), this loss directly aligns
EmbeddingGemma’s embedding space with that of a teacher model, allowing it to more effectively
learn from the larger, more powerful Gemini Embedding model. Note that unlike Kim et al. (2023),
we apply embedding matching not only to queries and passages but also to hard negative passages, as
we found this substantially improves performance. Intuitively, this serves the same purpose as using
hard negative passages in NCE loss, as the model learns how the teacher discriminates between the
queries and its corresponding hard negatives. We weigh these individual losses uniformly, letting
LD = LQ
D + LP+
D + LP−
D .

EmbeddingGemma: Powerful and Lightweight Text Representations
We adapt the contrastive and spread-out losses using MRL (Kusupati et al., 2022), which splits
each loss into 𝑘separate losses applied to 𝑘overlapping sub-dimensions of the embedding. We
consider each of these individual losses equally, simply adding their values during training without
any special weights. EmbeddingGemma provides 𝑑= 768 dimensional embeddings, additionally
supporting 512, 256, and 128 dimensional embeddings via MRL.
2.3. Recipe
We train EmbeddingGemma on a mixture of embedding tasks spanning various languages and task
types. In total, including encoder-decoder training, EmbeddingGemma sees approximately 2.1T
tokens, of which 314B are seen during pre-finetuning and 20B during finetuning.
Encoder-Decoder Training
We begin by adapting the decoder-only Gemma 3 model to an encoder-
decoder model to get a strong encoder with improved contextual representations. Following T5Gemma
(Zhang et al., 2025a), we initialize the encoder-decoder with the Gemma 3 decoder-only checkpoint
and further pretrain it on the Gemma 3 pretraining data with UL2 (Tay et al., 2023). We utilize the
pretrained encoder as the backbone for our embedding model, providing EmbeddingGemma with a
strong initialization from which it inherits extensive world knowledge, such as the 100+ languages
used to train Gemma 3.
Pre-finetuning
We then train the embedding model itself, starting with a pre-finetuning stage. Here
we train on large-scale unsupervised data, as has been previously shown to improve performance
(Gao et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2021). We use only (query, target) pairs as input, as the training
mixture is large and noisy, so mining high-quality hard negatives is challenging. We opt for a larger
batch size in order to stabilize the gradient, and because this improves performance by effectively
providing more (in-batch) negatives for each input example.
The goal of this stage is to build the model’s generalization capabilities by training for a large
number of steps over a diverse training set. As such, our pre-finetuning mixture spans both various,
evenly weighted task types—question answering, sentence similarity, code retrieval, and web search
tasks—and various languages (natural and programming). As part of this, we leverage a corpus
containing billions of title and body text pairs crawled from websites, much like in previous work
(Lee et al., 2024; Neelakantan et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024a).
Finetuning
Next, we finetune the model using a smaller but higher-quality mixture of task-specific
datasets. Here, we opt for a smaller batch size, and do utilize hard negatives. Note that both here and
in pre-finetuning, each batch only contains examples from a given dataset, as in-batch negatives are
more difficult to discern, and thus more valuable for contrastive learning, coming from the same task.
As in Gemini Embedding (Lee et al., 2025b), we utilize a set of three different groups of tasks
aimed at task diversity, language diversity, and coding capability, respectively. This includes a subset
of the academic datasets used by Gecko (Lee et al., 2024) and the synthetic datasets used by Gemini
Embedding. However, instead of directly determining the task mixture rates based on a fine-grained
grid search, we use the mixture resulting from this procedure as a seed for Bayesian optimization,
alongside 10 other random mixtures sampled from a Dirichlet distribution. This yields multiple
mixtures which individually result in stronger performance than the seeds. Moreover, thanks to a
balance of explore-exploit objectives, these mixtures specialize in different domains, creating experts
which synergize during souping.

Model Souping
Finally, we combine models from our finetuning runs by averaging their parameters,
to improve our final model’s quality and robustness. We assessed various methods including merging
checkpoints from various steps of a single training run (Izmailov et al., 2018) and from multiple
training runs using different hyperparameters (Wortsman et al., 2022). We find that mixtures obtained
from Bayesian optimization work well together as souping ingredients: our final model is the result
of an unweighted average of checkpoints from finetuning runs with each of the mixtures obtained
with Bayesian optimization.
Quantization-Aware Training
We additionally provide quantized versions of EmbeddingGemma
in standard quantization configurations. We provide checkpoints with three types of weight represen-
tations: int4 per-block, int8 per-block, and mixed-precision per-channel. We obtain these variants
by applying quantization-aware training (Jacob et al., 2018) during the model finetuning stage, to
minimize quality degradation for quantized checkpoints. Table 1 shows the quality is comparable
between our quantized checkpoints and our raw checkpoint (evaluated at half-precision bf16 weights).
3. Ablation Studies
We analyze some key design choices to better understand how they contributed to EmbeddingGemma’s
ability to produce high-quality embeddings across tasks and languages despite its small size. Models
for ablations are finetuned on only one mixture and thus exclude model souping, unless indicated
otherwise. We evaluate the models on MTEB(Multilingual, v2), as it covers various languages,
domains, and task types.
3.1. Initialization Strategy
Table 2 compares model performance when initialized with a decoder-only Gemma 3 model and with
an encoder-decoder based on that Gemma 3 model, trained as described in Section 2.3. Encoder-
decoder initialization outperforms decoder-only initialization across various task types. This suggests
the encoder-decoder is able to produce more expressive representations, as put forward in the
literature. As a baseline, we include the performance of a model initialized with random weights,
demonstrating both initialization strategies dramatically improve model performance.

Table 4 | Results using different training mixtures. Best result between the three mixtures is underlined.
3.2. Pooling Types
Poolers aggregate the transformer’s token representations into a single vector. In mean pooling,
we compute the average of all the token representations. In first-token pooling, we simply take
the representation of the first token and use it directly. In last-token pooling, we do the same, but
with the last token of the sequence. In attention pooling, we utilize an attention mechanism to
weigh and aggregate the token representations. Our pooled representations can be expressed as
Pembed = softmax( 𝑄𝐾⊤
√
𝑑𝑀)𝑉∈ℝ1×𝑑𝑀, where the input is passed through the key and value matrices,
𝐾, 𝑉∈ℝ𝐿×𝑑𝑀, and the query matrix 𝑄∈ℝ1×𝑑𝑀is a learnable parameter. We specifically employ
multi-head attention with four attention heads.
The results in Table 3 indicate that mean pooling yields the best performance, despite attention
pooling offering a large amount of additional learnable parameters. This is consistent with the results
from Suganthan et al. (2025), which found that simple pooling strategies outperformed attention
pooling in encoder-only models for classification and regression tasks, suggesting that these results
further extend to embedding tasks such as clustering.
3.3. Model Souping
Here, we train models on different model soup ingredients and compare their performance to our
final souped checkpoint: Table 4. The model soup not only improves on overall performance, but
even outperforms the ingredients in each task type. This indicates that model souping works not
only on runs with varied hyperparameter configurations, but also on runs with different finetuning
mixtures altogether. Note also that each mixture yields an expert in different task types.
4. Evaluation
We evaluate EmbeddingGemma on a comprehensive set of benchmarks covering diverse task types,
domains, languages, and language pairs. Specifically, we report numbers for the Massive Text
Embedding Benchmark (Enevoldsen et al., 2025; Muennighoff et al., 2022), XOR-Retrieve (Asai et al.,
2021), and XTREME-UP (Ruder et al., 2023).

Table 5 | Comparison of popular embedding models on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark:
MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(English, v2), and MTEB(Code). We also show results on XOR-Retrieve
and XTREME-UP, reporting Recall@5kt and MRR@10 respectively. ∗: Averaged over all code tasks
excluding COIRCodeSearchNetRetrieval, which was unavailable for most models.
†: For Gecko
Embedding (Lee et al., 2024), we evaluate a smaller version of the model discussed in the paper.
4.1. Tasks
MTEB consists of a massive collection of individual, quality-controlled evaluation tasks. Together, the
subsets we consider cover 250+ natural languages and 14+ programming languages, 20 domains (e.g.
legal, medical, news, programming, web), and 10 task types: bitext mining, classification, clustering,
instruction retrieval, multilabel classification, pair classification, reranking, retrieval, semantic text
similarity, and summarization. Our evaluations include 162 individual tasks, consisting of 131 tasks for
MTEB(Multilingual, v2), 41 tasks for MTEB(English, v2), and 12 code retrieval tasks for MTEB(Code).
XOR-Retrieve and XTREME-UP provide cross-lingual retrieval evaluations, with XOR-Retrieve pairing
English passages with retrieval queries in 7 different languages and XTREME-UP pairing English
passages with queries in 20 underrepresented Indo-European languages.
4.2. Methods
We compare our model to the most popular general-purpose embedding models in two categories: open
embedding models with fewer than a billion parameters and models available through commercial
APIs. For MTEB benchmarks, we additionally compare against the top models with fewer than 500M
parameters in the respective MTEB leaderboards. We exclude models trained on more than 25% of
the MTEB data to mitigate potential overfitting.

Table 6 | Performance of top leaderboard models under 500M parameters on MTEB(Multilingual, v2).
Rank is computed using Borda count against all models, regardless of parameter count.
We run our evaluations with half-precision weights (bfloat16), using the prompt instructions
detailed in the model card.4 We use a context length of 512 tokens for most evaluation tasks, increasing
to 1024 or 2048 for tasks such as LongEmbed Passkey Retrieval (Zhu et al., 2024), which require
longer input sequences.
4.3. Results
Overall Performance
In Table 5, we present EmbeddingGemma’s performance across MTEB bench-
marks, XOR-Retrieve, and XTREME-UP, comparing it to popular general-purpose embedding models.
Below, we also provide more thorough comparisons of MTEB benchmark performance, reporting
performance for other top models as well as for EmbeddingGemma’s lower-dimensional embeddings.
EmbeddingGemma pushes the limit for quality across several benchmarks. EmbeddingGemma
achieves the #1 rank and highest overall performance on the MTEB multilingual, English, and
code leaderboards across models under 500M parameters, with a significant lead over all previous
top performing models on each of the metrics summarizing aggregate performance across tasks (Task
Mean, Task Type Mean, and Borda rank). This gap persists when using fewer embedding dimensions:
Even with 128-dimensional embeddings, EmbeddingGemma achieves the highest scores for
Task Mean and Task Type Mean. EmbeddingGemma also achieves excellent scores on XOR-Retrieve
and XTREME-UP; in sum, these results demonstrate it is a state-of-the-art general-purpose model
with proven capabilities spanning cross-lingual, multilingual, English, and code tasks.
This performance advantage is not limited to small models: EmbeddingGemma is competitive
with larger models, providing performance comparable to state-of-the-art models nearly double
its size and with larger embedding dimensions; ranking #3, #2, and #2 across models under 1B
parameters on the MTEB multilingual, English, and code leaderboards respectively; and outperforming
commercial API models, with the notable exception of Gemini Embedding.
MTEB(Multilingual, v2)
We compare EmbeddingGemma to other top-ranked models from the
MTEB multilingual benchmark in Table 6. Besides achieving the highest values for the aggregate
scores, it leads in nearly all task types. Moreover, EmbeddingGemma offers drastic improvements in
each of the task types it excels at, even going so far as to compete with larger models. For example,
it outperforms Qwen3 Embedding 0.6B, the top-ranked model with fewer than 1B parameters, in
instruction retrieval, multilabel classification, pair classification, and reranking (Table 5).

Table 8 | Performance of top leaderboard models under 500M parameters on MTEB(Code, v1).
Rank is computed using Borda count against all models, regardless of parameter count.
MTEB(Eng, v2)
Compared to the models in Table 7, EmbeddingGemma again achieves the high-
est overall scores and exceptional improvements in classification (+8.5), clustering (+7.8), and
summarization (+4.4) compared to all other models. In fact, EmbeddingGemma also tops the sub-
1B-parameter leaderboard in these task types (again excluding models with possible data leakage
due to training with over 25% of the MTEB data).
MTEB(Code)
In Table 8, we compare results for the individual tasks present in the MTEB(Code)
benchmark. Note that only a few models (including EmbeddingGemma) have been submitted to
the MTEB(Code) leaderboard with evaluation metrics for all tasks. Specifically, most top models are
missing COIRCodeSearchNetRetrieval (COIR); for this reason, we additionally report the mean score
over the eleven remaining tasks, Mean -COIR. EmbeddingGemma achieves the best performance
in this metric in addition to all other aggregate metrics. Observe that, compared to the second-best
model, EmbeddingGemma provides dramatic performance increases in AppsRetrieval (+37.6) and
CosQA (+10.0), both of which require retrieving relevant code given natural language queries—–code
contest problems and web queries, respectively. This highlights EmbeddingGemma’s ability to create
representations which not only work across languages, but also across domains.

Table 9 | Performance of top multilingual models on XTREME-UP (MRR@10). †: For Gecko Embed-
ding (Lee et al., 2024), we evaluate a smaller version of the model discussed in the paper.
XTREME-UP
Table 9 shows results on XTREME-UP for EmbeddingGemma and other top multilingual
models. The XTREME-UP cross-lingual retrieval task involves mapping queries in 20 underrepresented
languages to English passages. EmbeddingGemma’s performance is remarkable, vastly outperforming
top models with billions of parameters as well as commercial API models. Moreover, against the
selected open models, EmbeddingGemma achieves the strongest performance for each individual
language evaluated, being outperformed only by a commercial model in two languages. Note that
even models with strong performance in the MTEB multilingual benchmark may struggle in XTREME-
UP, such as Qwen3 Embedding 0.6B (Zhang et al., 2025b) and Jina Embeddings v3 (Sturua et al.,
2024). This highlights EmbeddingGemma’s exceptional capability in low-resource languages.
5. Future Work
We intend to extend EmbeddingGemma’s capabilities beyond text, into modalities such as image,
audio, and video. This includes exploring new recipes to excel simultaneously at various unimodal
(e.g. text ⇔text), cross-modal (e.g. text ⇔image), and multimodal (e.g. text+image ⇔image) use
cases. Gemma 3 has demonstrated strong multimodal understanding, and previous work has shown
promise in adapting multimodal large language models into multimodal embedding models, (Jiang
et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2025). However, these models use several billion parameters; we aim to
fulfill the need for lightweight, natively multimodal embedding models able to be run on-device.
6. Conclusion
EmbeddingGemma is a lightweight yet powerful general-purpose embedding model built upon the
Gemma 3 language model family. Our novel training recipe leverages knowledge from larger models
through initialization from a rich T5Gemma encoder and distillation from the highly-capable Gemini
Embedding model. It also includes spread-out regularization and model merging with multiple
optimized mixtures, to ensure that the resulting representations are expressive and generalizable. As
a result, EmbeddingGemma sets a new standard for resource-efficient text embeddings.
Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that EmbeddingGemma pushes the state-of-the-art across
multilingual, English, and code benchmarks on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)
leaderboard for models under 500M parameters, and its performance is even comparable to models
twice its size. This lead persists when using quantization for low-cost inference or truncating
embeddings to reduce storage costs.
By delivering state-of-the-art performance in a compact size, EmbeddingGemma addresses the
growing demand for models that enable faster, private, and offline-capable applications directly on
user devices. We release our checkpoints to the community to accelerate research and development
in efficient models.
