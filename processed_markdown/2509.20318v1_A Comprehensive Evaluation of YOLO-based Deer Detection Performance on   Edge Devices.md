## 1. Introduction

## ABSTRACT

The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S., highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies such as fencing, use of repellents, and conventional scare tactics. These methods are often laborintensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming systems. To address this challenge, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous solutions capable of real-time wildlife detection and deterrence. At the core of such systems lies accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the viability of deer detection systems on edge devices. Addressing this gap, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available dataset of 3,095 annotated images with boundingbox annotations of deer, derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project, representing challenging realworld scenarios. Second, we provide an extensive comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing platforms: the CPU-based Raspberry Pi 5 and the GPU-accelerated NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier to assess feasibility for real-world field deployment. Results show that the real-time detection performance is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 &gt; 0.85) and computational efficiency (FPS &gt; 30). To support further research, both the source code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/WinnerBishal/track-the-deer .

The growing deer population across the United States is a serious challenge for farmers since they have to bear significant economic losses that arise from deer intrusion into farms where crops like corn, soybeans, cotton, and wheat are planted. For instance, the state of Mississippi is home to the largest deer density across the nation, where a survey of row crop producers revealed that 17,830 total acres of farmland were affected by deer damage, resulting in an annual economic loss of staggering $4.6 million (Mills and Croft, 2025). The issue extends to the whole of the U.S. as the research shows, the combined loss due to wildlife damage across corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton was estimated to be $592.6 million (McKee et al., 2021) and another research identified that the primary wildlife species responsible for the most widespread and highest crop damage across the U.S. is white-tailed deer (Boyer et al., 2024).

People have explored a variety of control methods to reduce wildlife-related crop damage, such as fencing, hunting, trapping, and repellents. Each of these approaches, however, presents significant limitations in terms of cost, scalability, and long-term sustainability. Fencing is one of the most widely used deterrents, and high-tensile or electrified fences can be effective in reducing incursions by deer. However, the costs are prohibitive for large-scale agricultural operations, averaging $13,000 per mile, and ongoing maintenance is required to repair damage from storms, fallen trees, or determined animals (Landguth et al., 2020). Moreover, persistent deer often learn to breach or circumvent barriers, reducing effectiveness over time. Hunting and culling programs represent another strategy. Regulated hunting seasons can provide some localized relief, but they are typically seasonal and therefore do not allow for year-round mitigation of crop losses. More intensive culling programs may reduce populations more significantly, yet they often face public opposition, animal welfare concerns, and ecological debates about altering wildlife populations. These programs also require permits from relevant wildlife management agencies, limiting farmers' autonomy and flexibility (Warren, 2011).

Trapping is often employed for wild pigs and can be effective when used strategically with large corral-style traps. Yet this method is highly labor-intensive, requiring constant monitoring, baiting, and maintenance. Trapping also carries the risk of capturing non-target wildlife, raising both ecological and ethical concerns (Conover, 2001). In addition, while trapping may temporarily suppress populations in localized areas, wild pigs reproduce rapidly and reinvade treated lands, making trapping alone insufficient as a long-term solution. Repellents have also been widely studied, particularly for deer (el Hani and Conover, 1995). While chemical or odorbased repellents can temporarily reduce browsing pressure, they typically degrade quickly after rain, wind, or sun exposure and therefore require frequent reapplication. Overall, these approaches are largely reactive rather than proactive , addressing the problem only after damage has occurred. They are often unsustainable in the long term and may cause unnecessary stress, injury, or mortality to wildlife, raising ethical as well as ecological concerns (Dubois et al., 2017).

Machine vision serves as the foundation for these emerging deterrence systems, acting as the 'eyes' for real-time deer detection. Among the available approaches, YOLO models have been preferred over two-stage detectors (e.g., Faster R-CNN or EfficientDet), due to their balance of accuracy and speed, making them well-suited for field deployment (I et al., 2025; Li et al., 2023). For instance, I et al. (2025) demonstrated the superiority of YOLOv10 over YOLOv5 for wildlife detection on an NVIDIA Jetson

Sustainable wildlife management that actively prevents deer from entering farms without lethal measures represents a foundational solution to these challenges (Abed et al., 2025; Kovacs and Hajnal, 2024). Future systems can leverage advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques, most notably YOLO models (Terven et al., 2023), to achieve highly accurate and real-time identification of deer presence and movement (Sharma et al., 2024). Detailed outputs, such as the location of deer within an image or enhanced segmentation masks, can then trigger tailored, dynamic deterrents including species-specific sound or light emissions, or autonomous maneuvers by UAVs and UGVs (Roca et al., 2024). A common design pattern in emerging research involves a hierarchical process in which initial motion detection, often through Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors, activates more sophisticated vision-based models for animal detection. For example, S et al. (2025) integrated a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify animals, which then activated non-lethal deterrents such as ultrasonic sounds, flashing lights, or sprinklers. Similarly, Mishra and Yadav (2024) employed a PIR sensor to trigger a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), which in turn activated species-specific ultrasonic frequencies to mitigate habituation. More advanced systems have also been developed for other species. For instance, R et al. (2025) designed a wild boar deterrent system that uses YOLOv5n (Jocher et al., 2020) to confirm presence before escalating deterrents from ultrasonic sound to predator scent (wolf urine) and vocalizations.

Nano, achieving a mAP@0.5 of 0.934. Similarly, Nishanth et al. (2024) implemented a YOLOv8m-based surveillance system on a Raspberry Pi, showing its feasibility on lowpower edge devices. In a more recent application, Temesgen et al. (2025) deployed a TensorRT-optimized YOLOv5 model on an NVIDIA Jetson Orion Nano for a UAV-based deterrence system, achieving an inference time of only 0.025 seconds per frame. Collectively, these studies affirm that the YOLO family of models has become the de facto standard for practical, high-performance wildlife detection systems on edge hardware.

On the other hand, existing studies have primarily focused on individual YOLO models, without providing comprehensive benchmarking across architectures or systematic evaluations. In addition, most of the studies only evaluated the models' performance on high-end GPU devices, and few works have examined performance on edge devices in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, which is critical for practical field deployment. To address these gaps, we present a publicly available dataset of 3,095 annotated deer images with bounding-box labels, derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project, representing challenging real-world scenarios. Using this dataset, we establish a comprehensive benchmark of YOLOv8-YOLOv11 models, evaluating performance not only on a high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU but also on resource-constrained platforms, including the CPU-based Raspberry Pi 5 and the GPU-accelerated NVIDIA Jetson AGXXavier. This research is expected to provide a valuable resource for advancing machine vision systems for wildlife detection and control, as well as related applications in agriculture and beyond. The key contributions of this work are as follows:

Despite recent advancements, most deer and wildlife detection studies continue to rely on private datasets or generalpurpose object detection datasets. For instance, Abood et al. (2023) applied YOLOv5 to the PASCAL VOC dataset, while others utilized aggregated datasets from Roboflow Universe that include multiple animal classes (I et al., 2025; Nishanth et al., 2024). In deer-specific research, custom datasets have been used for detecting Sika deer from camera traps with YOLOv8n (Sharma et al., 2024) and for identifying various deer species from UAV imagery with YOLOv8seg (Roca et al., 2025). However, these datasets are often limited to simplified scenarios focused on targeted deer populations and are generally not publicly available, making reproducibility and broad benchmarking difficult. Table 1 summarizes representative studies, highlighting the critical need for publicly available, high-quality, domain-specific datasets that reflect the complex and variable conditions of real farms and fields.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data acquisition methods, model selection, training, testing, and inference metrics. Section 3 presents the model evaluation results, along with the limitations of the study. Finally, Section 4 provides concluding remarks and potential directions for future work.

## 2. Materials and Methods

This section describes the data acquisition process, the YOLO models employed, the training procedure, and the model evaluation strategy, followed by inference experiments conducted on edge devices.

## 2.1. Data acquisition

To better represent these scenarios, we curated a second dataset from the Idaho Cameratraps project, shared by the

To enable a comprehensive comparison, we curated two deer image datasets. We first selected a dataset from Roboflow Universe containing annotated images of deer, which we refer to as the 'Roboflow dataset' in subsequent discussions. As shown in Figure 1, the Roboflow dataset (Dyer, 2022) consists of 2,339 images of different deer species captured in diverse environments, mostly under favorable lighting conditions and with minimal motion, as is common in manually photographed images. The dataset was divided into 2,043 training images and 296 validation images. However, as shown in Figure 1, this type of dataset does not fully capture the challenges of real-world field conditions, such as low-light environments, motion blur, partial occlusion, and varying camera trap settings.

Idaho Department of Fish and Game via the LILA BC online repository (Morris, 2022). The Cameratraps project contains over 1.5 million camera trap images collected from video sequences across multiple regions. While the original dataset provides only sequence-level labels without bounding-box annotations, we filtered approximately 7,000 images containing deer (confidence score &gt; 0.9) and manually annotated 3,095 images with bounding boxes using the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) (Corporation, 2024). This 'Cameratrap dataset' was then divided into 2,578 training images and 517 validation images. Some representative samples are shown in Figure 1.

The two datasets differ significantly in complexity and realism. The Roboflow dataset consists of clean, manually photographed images of deer, mostly under good lighting and with limited motion or occlusion, making it more suitable for baseline model training. In contrast, the Cameratrap dataset captures deer under challenging real-world conditions, including varying backgrounds, night/low-light settings, occlusion, and camouflage. As shown in Figure 1, the Cameratrap dataset therefore provides a more realistic benchmark for evaluating model robustness in field deployments.

## 2.2. Deep learning models

The You Only Look Once (YOLO) framework made a groundbreaking contribution to computer vision, particularly in object detection, by introducing a single-pass approach that framed detection as a regression problem. This innovation enabled real-time inference, which was lacking in other state-of-the-art models at the time (Redmon et al., 2016). Since then, the YOLO family has evolved rapidly, producing numerous variants that build on the original design with architectural and performance enhancements (Terven et al., 2023).

In this study, we focus on four recent versions, YOLOv8, YOLOv9,YOLOv10,andYOLOv11,forcomparativebenchmarking. The study is further constrained to the three most lightweight variants of each model family: nano (n), small (s), and medium (m). Notably, for YOLOv9, the tiny (t) variant was utilized because it has a similar parameter count as for nano-scale variants. YOLOv8 introduced notable improvements, including an anchor-free detection method for enhanced accuracy, architectural refinements in the backbone and detection head to better capture objects of varying scales, and a decoupled head design that further improved precision (Yaseen, 2024; Varghese and M., 2024). We conclude our comparisons with YOLOv11, as subsequent models such as YOLOv12 shift toward attention-centric vision transformer architectures, representing a fundamental departure from the CNN-based architectures of earlier YOLO versions (Tian et al., 2025).

## 2.2.1. YOLOv8

YOLOv8, developed by Ultralytics, represents a stateof-the-art object detection model that introduced several architectural improvements over its predecessor, YOLOv5 (Hussain, 2024). One of its key innovations is anchor-free estimation, which accelerates post-processing, particularly Non-MaximumSuppression (NMS), for selecting prediction boxes (Solawetz and Francesco, 2024). Additionally, the model employs the CSPDarknet backbone, which reduces computational complexity while maintaining accuracy by splitting feature maps and incorporating the Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) activation function (Hussain, 2024). This design enhances gradient flow and feature reuse, resulting in smaller, more efficient models well-suited for edge devices. Furthermore, YOLOv8 integrates a PANet neck, which improves multi-scale feature learning by augmenting the traditional Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with a bottom-up path alongside the top-down pathway (Reis et al., 2024). Another improvement is the C2f (Cross Stage Partial network with two fusion blocks) module, which captures complex patterns more effectively, further boosting model accuracy (Hussain, 2024; Talib et al., 2024). Ultralytics provides YOLOv8 in five sizes ('n', 's', 'm', 'l', and 'x'), offering flexibility depending on accuracy and resource constraints. The smallest model, YOLOv8n, has 3.2 million parameters, while the largest, YOLOv8x, has approximately 257.8 million parameters.

## 2.2.2. YOLOv9

YOLOv9 architecture marks a significant improvement over earlier YOLO versions in terms of speed and accuracy of object detection. A key challenge it addressed is the information bottleneck problem in deep neural networks, where gradients diminish or useful information is lost as they propagate through successive layers of large models. To overcome this, YOLOv9 introduced Programmable Gradient Information (PGI), which ensures more reliable gradient flow and enhances the network's ability to learn from complex image features. As shown in Figure 2, PGI is implemented through a reversible auxiliary branch that updates the main branch by generating useful gradients through a supervision mechanism. Moreover, YOLOv9 introduced the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN), an

Figure 2: Overview of YOLOv9 architecture (Hidayatullah and Tubagus, 2024).

<!-- image -->

advancement over the original ELAN architecture. Unlike ELAN,whichrelied solely on convolutional blocks, GELAN can flexibly incorporate different computational blocks, improving both efficiency and generalization. Together, the integration of PGI and GELAN enables YOLOv9 to achieve robust gradient flow, efficient computation, and superior detection performance (Wang et al., 2024b; Parambil et al., 2024).

## 2.2.3. YOLOv10

YOLOv10 also redesigned its convolutional blocks to reduce redundancy. Traditional YOLO architectures used 3×3 convolutions with a stride of 2 to simultaneously downsample spatial dimensions (from H×W to H/2×W/2) and expand channels (from C to 2C). In contrast, YOLOv10 decouples these operations: a pointwise convolution first handles channel transformations, followed by a depthwise convolution for spatial downsampling. This design significantly reduces computational overhead. To further enhance

YOLOv10 introduced several architectural innovations aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy, while addressing key limitations in earlier YOLO versions (Wang et al., 2024a). One major issue identified in prior models was the reliance on Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) during post-processing, which added computational overhead and delayed inference. To overcome this, YOLOv10 adopted NMS-free training by incorporating a one-to-one prediction head alongside the traditional one-to-many head during training, allowing the network to optimize using both. However, at inference time, only the one-to-one head is used, which eliminates the need for NMS and enables faster, end-to-end deployment. Another notable improvement is the simplification of the classification head. The authors observed that the regression head plays a more critical role in YOLO performance, so the classification head was streamlined to reduce computational cost without sacrificing accuracy.

accuracy, YOLOv10 integrates partial self-attention and employs improved large-kernel convolutions, particularly for lightweight models. Together, these modifications result in a more efficient and accurate object detection framework suitable for real-time applications.

## 2.2.4. YOLOv11

YOLOv11 represents the most recent advancement in the YOLO family, developed by Ultralytics as a more sophisticated yet efficient model. It extends the versatility of YOLO by supporting multiple computer vision tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation, while maintaining strong performance relative to its size (Khanam and Hussain, 2024). Built upon the YOLOv8 architecture, YOLOv11 introduces two key innovations. The C2PSA (Cross Stage Partial with Spatial Attention) block enables the model to focus on the most relevant regions of an image, thereby improving its ability to detect small and occluded objects. Meanwhile, the C3k2

(Cross Stage Partial with 3 Convolutions and 2 Kernels) block reduces computational complexity while preserving rich feature representations, making the model more efficient without compromising accuracy.

Ultralytics maintains the YOLO family of models and provides open-source implementations of the versions they primarily developed, such as YOLOv8 and YOLOv11. In practice, YOLO models present a tradeoff between model size and reliability. Although they are widely applicable across various computer vision tasks, our study focuses specifically on their object detection capabilities. To capture the balance between performance and computational efficiency, we selected the 'n', 's', and 'm' variants of each model. Among these, shown in Table 2, YOLOv8m is the largest, with 25.84 million parameters, while YOLOv9t is the smallest, with only 1.94 million parameters. As discussed in earlier sections, each version incorporates different techniques for gradient flow, optimization, and image processing. By testing performance across a wide range of architectural variations and model sizes, we aim to provide deeper insights that support informed decision-making when selecting YOLO models for deer detection tasks.

## 2.3. Training

The YOLO models were trained on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX5090 GPU with 32 GB of VRAM, a high-end platform well-suited for deep learning workloads. As summarized in Table 3, the training was conducted on a Linux machine with CUDA version 12.9. While the default training configurations provided by Ultralytics are effective, adjustments were made to better leverage the available hardware. In particular, the batch size and number of workers were tuned for different models based on their parameter size. Larger batch sizes enable faster training by improving GPU utilization (Gusak et al., 2022), but they are constrained by memory usage, especially for larger models. Therefore, careful experimentation was conducted to identify the optimal values for batch size and number of workers given the model size and available VRAM. All models were trained for a total of 100 epochs under these optimized settings.

## 2.4. Testing and performance evaluation

Intersection over Union (IoU): IoU is a widely adopted metric used to evaluate the correctness of detections produced by an object detection model. The model is trained to predict bounding boxes around objects in an image, and IoU measures how closely these predictions match the groundtruth bounding boxes (Padilla et al., 2020).

In this subsection, we discuss the standard performance metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of deer detection models. In this study, the model needs to correctly identify the presence of deer in an image and localize them with bounding boxes. To quantify accuracy, we report precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP). In addition, inference time is measured to assess computational efficiency and the feasibility of real-time deployment.

Precision (P) : Precision quantifies the proportion of detections that are correct, i.e., true positives relative to all

F1 Score : The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single balanced measure of detection accuracy at a given confidence threshold.

Recall (R) : Recall measures the proportion of groundtruth objects correctly detected, i.e., true positives relative to all actual objects. Missed detections or those failing the IoU threshold contribute to false negatives.

AP (Average Precision) : AP summarizes the tradeoff between precision and recall across confidence thresholds by computing the area under the precision-recall curve. Higher AP values indicate better overall detection performance (Padilla et al., 2020).

Inference Time : Inference time is the average time required for a model to process an input image and generate detections. It reflects computational efficiency and determines the feasibility of real-time deployment.

Mean Average Precision (mAP) : mAP is the mean of AP across all predicted classes. In this study, it reduces to the APofthe single 'Deer' class. Commonly reported values include mAP@0.5 (IoU threshold of 0.5) and mAP@0.5:0.95 (averaged across thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 with step size 0.05).

Processing Time : Processing time includes additional steps outside inference, such as image pre-processing, nonmaximumsuppression, and visualization of bounding boxes. Together with inference time, it determines the total detection time. Combined with inference time, it defines the total detection time, expressed as: Total Time = Inference time + Processing Time.

Frames Per Second (FPS) : FPS is derived from total detection time and indicates the maximum frame rate achievable in live video applications on a given device.

In this study, we use IoU , precision, recall, F1-score, AP, and mAP to measure detection accuracy, while inference time and processing time are used to evaluate computational speed. For a more detailed discussion of these metrics, readers are referred to Padilla et al. (2020).

## 2.5. Inference on edge devices

Edge computing provides an alternative by enabling local image or video processing, thereby reducing latency and ensuring rapid response. Performing all computation on the local device also creates an independent detection and tracking system, which is particularly advantageous in remote agricultural settings where reliable cloud connectivity cannot be guaranteed (Galliera and Suri, 2022). A wide range of off-the-shelf edge devices are available for such applications, including single-board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson platforms, USB accelerators, and mobile devices with embedded CPUs and GPUs (Alqahtani et al., 2024). In this study, we evaluate inference performance on two representative devices: a CPUbased Raspberry Pi and a GPU-accelerated NVIDIA Jetson platform (Figure 3).

The YOLO models were trained on high-performance workstations, as described in Section 2.3. However, for applications such as deer detection, real-time identification and localization are essential for system effectiveness. One approach is to outsource inference to a cloud-based server, where live video frames are continuously transmitted and processed, with detection results returned to the client (Bandaru et al., 2024). However, such solutions often face challenges related to bandwidth requirements, latency, and network security.

## 2.5.1. Raspberry Pi 5

Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers that offer low-cost, small-sized hardware for computing. They are often credit-card-sized but deliver excellent computing power for their size. In this study, we test the performance of trained models on Raspberry Pi 5, which is the newest model of the Raspberry Pi series, as shown in Figure 3. It features an onboard computer with a quadcore 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 CPU. Raspberry Pi is widely used in applications like real-time image or video processing since it supports a dedicated Camera Serial Interface (CSI) .

Moreover, it can operate on low power, making it suitable for remote deployment as an independent computer, able to get real-time data from the environment, such as the presence of deer in our case. For this study, a device with 16 GB system memory and the operating system Linux Ubuntu 22.04 was used.

## 2.5.2. Jetson AGX Xavier

NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier is a powerful edge device designed explicitly to address the rigorous demands of robotics and edge AI applications. It is centered around a highly integrated System-on-Chip (SoC) that combines Volta GPU, ARM-based CPUs, and specialized hardware accelerators within a unified memory framework. The GPU incorporates 512 CUDA cores and 64 tensor cores, capable of delivering up to 11 TFLOPS (FP16) or 22 TOPS (INT8). It operates at a maximum frequency of 1.37 GHz with dynamic scaling, enabling fine-grained control of power and performance (Cetre et al., 2022). The tensor cores provide significant efficiency for AI workloads, as they are optimized for matrix multiply-accumulate (MMA) operations, which underpin most deep learning algorithms. Moreover, the AGX Xavier integrates dedicated accelerators such as Deep Learning Accelerators (DLA) and Programmable Vision Accelerators (PVA), providing hardware-level support for diverse workloads in autonomous and embedded systems. Moreover, this device, shown in Figure 3 (right), comes with a compact form factor of 4.2 x 4.2 x 4 inches. Together, these features make the Jetson AGX Xavier a versatile platform for real-time robotics and edge AI deployment.

## 2.5.3. Model deployment and optimization

In this study, we evaluated the YOLO models on both devices by converting them to ONNX format. ONNX provides a framework-agnostic representation of deep learning models as computation graphs, enabling portability across platforms (Joshua et al., 2025). Inference was performed using

While powerful hardware provides the foundation for high-speed computing, the performance of AI models is equally dependent on their software implementations (Ravi et al., 2025). To fully exploit the capabilities of the edge devices, specialized software frameworks and optimizations are required. Ultralytics provides YOLO models with optimizations for accuracy and speed; however, the default PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) exports are not always the most efficient for deployment on storage- and performanceconstrained devices. To address this, several open-source model optimization methods enable faster inference without compromising accuracy. Common export and deployment formats include ONNX, OpenVINO, TorchScript, TensorFlow Lite, NCNN, and TensorRT (Iqbal et al., 2024). Each format supports different types of AI models while incorporating optimizations to improve inference speed on specific hardware. In many cases, the creators of these model frameworks also provide dedicated runtime platforms to ensure efficient execution across devices.

ONNX Runtime, a lightweight, high-performance engine that reduces deployment overhead and supports hardwarespecific optimizations via execution providers (e.g., ARM CPUs or CUDA GPUs). These features make ONNX a widely adopted choice for efficient model deployment.

## 3. Experiments and Results

In this section, we first evaluate model performance when trained on the Roboflow dataset and tested on the Cameratraps dataset, highlighting the differences between an existing dataset and our curated dataset. We then present results obtained on a high-end GPU workstation, followed by inference performance on two representative edge devices.

## 3.1. Cross-dataset evaluation

To evaluate the contribution of our curated dataset, we performed a cross-dataset experiment on the high-end GPU (Table 3) by training models on the Roboflow dataset and testing them on the Cameratraps dataset. As shown in Table 4, all models achieved excellent performance when trained and tested on the Roboflow dataset, with YOLOv11n reaching an mAP of 0.9920 and mAP@50-95 of 0.8475. However, when the same models were tested on the Cameratraps dataset, performance dropped sharply. For instance, YOLOv11n achieved only 0.7395 mAP and 0.5341 mAP@50-95, despite its near-perfect results on Roboflow. This substantial performance gap highlights the limitations of existing datasets such as Roboflow, which consist mostly of clean, well-lit images, and do not capture the challenging conditions present in real-world scenarios. In contrast, the Cameratraps dataset includes varied lighting, occlusion, camouflage, and motion blur, making it a more realistic benchmark for wildlife detection. Figure 4 shows some successful detections by the YOLOv11m model on the Cameratraps testing dataset across different scenarios. These images are carefully curated difficult scenarios, but the model shows an impressive ability to handle varied lighting conditions, distances, and deer poses. Therefore, this evaluation confirms the necessity of using domainrepresentative datasets. For the remainder of this study, we adopt the Cameratraps dataset as the primary evaluation dataset to ensure that results reflect real-field applicability.

## 3.2. Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-based inference)

Table 5 summarizes the performance of the YOLO models on the Raspberry Pi 5. With only CPU support, inference times were orders of magnitude slower than on the benchmark GPU. Even the smallest model, YOLOv9t, required over 250 ms per inference, corresponding to fewer than 4 frames per second (FPS). Larger models, such as YOLOv8m, exceeded 1.5 seconds per frame. These low frame rates are inadequate for monitoring or tracking moving animals, making CPU-only deployment impractical for realtime applications on this class of hardware.

Figure 5 shows the latency-reliability trade-off for YOLO models on the Raspberry Pi 5. The bar plot represents inference time ( ms ), while the line plot indicates AP@0.5. The results illustrate the inherent trade-off between detection accuracy and computational latency: smaller models, such as YOLOv9t, achieve lower latency but at the cost of reduced accuracy, whereas larger models like YOLOv8m and YOLOv11m provide higher accuracy but suffer from prohibitive inference times. This also highlights the challenge of balancing model complexity and deployability on CPU-only edge devices.

The performance results, detailed in Table 5, highlight the significant computational challenge this presents. While the detection accuracy (mAP@0.5) remains unchanged, as it is a function of the model's weights, the inference times are orders of magnitude higher than on the benchmark GPU as evident from the table. Even the smallest model, YOLOv9t, required over 250 ms for a single inference, resulting in a detection speed of less than 4 frames per second (FPS). For the larger models, such as YOLOv8m, the total time exceeded 1.5 seconds per frame. Such low frame rates are insufficient for monitoring or tracking moving animals, rendering most models impractical for any application requiring real-time responsiveness on this class of hardware.

## 3.3. NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier (GPU-Accelerated Inference)

As discussed above, CPU-based edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi 5 face severe latency constraints. In contrast, as shown in Table 5, the Jetson AGX Xavier achieved substantially lower inference times across all models, demonstrating the advantage of the Volta GPU architecture. The smallest models, such as YOLOv11n and YOLOv10n, delivered detection speeds exceeding 40 FPS, comfortably meeting the requirements for real-time video analysis. Even mediumsized models, including YOLOv11s and YOLOv8s, sustained performance above 20 FPS. Figure 6 further illustrates the latency-reliability trade-off across models on the Jetson platform. Inference times remained below 70 ms even

Figure 5: Latency-reliability trade-off across models on Raspberry Pi.

<!-- image -->

for the larger models, while accuracy (AP@0.5) consistently stayed above 0.85. These results confirm that the Jetson can support both lightweight and medium-sized YOLO models with real-time throughput, a stark contrast to the Raspberry Pi.

This level of throughput enables not only accurate detection but also continuous tracking and the ability to trigger dynamic, responsive deterrence. These results indicate that the full set of evaluated models can be effectively deployed on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier when combined with efficient preprocessing and post-processing pipelines.

## 3.4. Comparative analysis of model performance

Figure 7 provides a comparative evaluation of deer detection models across two edge devices. The time axis is shown on a logarithmic scale to accommodate the ordersof-magnitude difference in processing speed. Two distinct clusters of results are apparent: the NVIDIA Jetson models are concentrated in the low-latency region (below 200 ms), while the Raspberry Pi models are spread across a much

<!-- image -->

wider range, extending from 200 ms to nearly 2000 ms. Here, total time represents the sum of inference, preprocessing, and postprocessing times (see Section 2.4). As noted earlier, differences in total time relative to inference time are primarily attributable to software inefficiencies. The plot illustrates the 'efficiency frontier' for each device, defined as the set of models offering the best accuracy for a given level of performance. On the Jetson, this frontier is nearly vertical, indicating that models can achieve high F1-scores without sacrificing latency. By contrast, the Raspberry Pi's efficiency frontier is much more extended. Models from the m series in all YOLO versions fail to deliver adequate throughput, and even smaller models face latency challenges. Nevertheless, lightweight variants such as YOLOv8n and YOLOv11n achieve the best balance, sustaining competitive accuracy while remaining relatively efficient. This analysis highlights that for CPU-bound platforms like the Raspberry Pi, model selection must carefully balance accuracy against the practical frame-rate requirements of real-time applications. In contrast, GPU-accelerated platforms such as the Jetson provide greater flexibility, allowing higher accuracy models to be deployed without significant performance trade-offs.

## 3.5. Discussion

## 3.5.1. Choices of CPU or GPU edge devices

The choice between CPU- and GPU-based edge devices depends largely on the requirements of the target application. CPU platforms, such as the Raspberry Pi, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and suitable for lightweight tasks where occasional or event-triggered detections are sufficient, for example, confirming the presence of a stationary animal or supporting long-term monitoring in power-constrained environments. By contrast, GPU-accelerated platforms, such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, are better suited for real-time applications that demand high-frame-rate video analysis, continuous tracking, and rapid decision-making. The Jetson provides the computational capacity to run larger models at interactive speeds, making it ideal for dynamic scenarios where animals are moving, and system responsiveness is critical. In practice, the Raspberry Pi offers accessibility and low-power operation, while the Jetson delivers the performance necessary for advanced, real-time wildlife detection and deterrence. The decision between the two thus reflects a trade-off between efficiency, cost, and the level of intelligence required at the edge.

## 3.5.2. Robustness to other species

In this work, we curated the Cameratraps dataset, which covers a diverse and challenging range of environmental conditions (see Figure 1). However, the dataset is dominated by white-tailed deer, and thus the ability of the models to generalize to other deer species, or to avoid misclassifying non-deer animals as deer, has not yet been evaluated. For deployment in a real-world automatic deer deterrence system, robustness against such incorrect classifications is essential. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods could be applied to mitigate these risks (Liu et al., 2021). Achieving this will require additional studies, including the development of a multi-species dataset to rigorously test cross-species generalization and misclassification robustness.

## 3.5.3. Real-world deployment

Our evaluation on edge devices showed strong detection accuracy across platforms, but real-world deployment also requires speed, efficiency, and reliability. The NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier offered a favorable balance of performance and accuracy, supporting real-time operation. In contrast, smaller low-power devices such as the Raspberry Pi 5 performed poorly with larger models, where high GFLOPs demands quickly overwhelmed the CPU. The study further indicates that simply converting PyTorch models to ONNX and running them with ONNX Runtime is insufficient for achieving real-time performance on the Raspberry Pi. Additional optimizations are necessary, including lightweight frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite and improvements in preprocessing and postprocessing pipelines (Iqbal et al.,

2024). To enable real-time deployment on constrained platforms like the Raspberry Pi 5, future efforts should focus on advanced model optimization techniques, more efficient inference engines, and lighter architectures. These measures are essential to minimize resource usage while maintaining acceptable detection performance in practical field settings.

## 4. Conclusion

Future work will focus on hardware-specific optimization techniques and lightweight frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite to further improve performance on constrained devices. Additionally, we plan to expand the dataset by collecting and annotating images that capture a wider range of challenging conditions, including adverse weather (e.g., snow, heavy rain, fog), diverse agricultural landscapes (e.g., cornfields, soybean fields), and a greater variety of deer species and behaviors.

In this paper, we introduced an open-source dataset of 3,095 annotated deer images with bounding-box labels, capturing diverse environmental conditions and lighting scenarios. We benchmarked 12 model variants from four recent YOLO architectures (v8, v9, v10, and v11) and evaluated their performance on two representative edge devices: the CPU-based Raspberry Pi 5 and the GPU-powered NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results showed that larger m-series models achieved the highest accuracy on high-end hardware, with mAP@0.5 scores exceeding 0.94. However, their computational demands made them unsuitable for real-time deployment on CPU-only devices such as the Raspberry Pi 5, where performance dropped below 1 FPS. In contrast, the Jetson AGX Xavier provided an optimal balance, sustaining real-time processing speeds above 25 FPS while maintaining high detection accuracy (mAP@0.5 &gt; 0.85). These findings demonstrate that GPU-accelerated hardware is a prerequisite for real-time wildlife tracking at the edge.
